# Task
You are in the conclude phase. The development task has been interrupted (timeout,
cancellation, or project completion). You need to summarize the key results that have
already been confirmed so far.

You will receive a YAML snapshot of the task graph. Study it to understand the context.
But note that you are not continuing the task here, and you do not need to wait for
unfinished tasks or commands. You only need to summarize the key facts that have already
been confirmed so far.

This is the conclude phase. It overrides any earlier instruction in the same session
that told you to keep working, continue building, solve Goal, wait for command results,
or perform more actions.

# Output Requirements
Return only one raw JSON object. Do not output anything else. The JSON must be valid,
including proper escaping of quotation marks.

When rejecting a task, return the following:
```json
{"accepted": false, "reason": "policy_refusal"}
```

Normal return example:
```json
{"accepted": true, "data": {"description": "..."}}
```

# Rules
- Stop immediately and produce the JSON now. Do not continue the task.
- Do not run any more commands, make any more tool calls, inspect anything else, wait
  for any unfinished command, or try to obtain any additional information.
- Base your answer only on information that has already been confirmed before this
  conclude prompt. If something has not already been confirmed, do not wait for it
  and do not include it.
- This JSON summary is your final output for this phase. After outputting it, stop.
- `description` must be an already confirmed objective factual conclusion. Include the
  file path of any script that was created or improved, and summarize what progress was
  made (even if partial). Do not output plans, guesses, or explanatory filler.
- Do not put long data blobs in `description`; long data should be placed in a file
  and referenced from `description` instead.
- `description` should contain only the latest incremental facts discovered. Do not repeat
  information already present in the graph snapshot.
